## 📦 Configuration

Follow the [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) to set up your system.

Once Arch is installed and this repository cloned locally, the fastest way to set up the system is by running the different `make` targets defined in the `Makefile`. Each target handles the configuration for different components of the system.

For example, to set up your shell configuration:

```bash
make shell
```

### 🧰 Utility Scripts

The repository includes several useful scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

### 🔧 Post-Installation Steps

After setting up the basic configuration, run:

```bash
make post-installation
```

These steps need to be done manually until I automate them!
