# Plan

Create clear, actionable, and efficient plans.

1. **Clarify First**
   - Ask targeted questions to understand the goal, constraints, and success criteria
   - Identify any ambiguities or assumptions that need validation
   - Confirm the scope and boundaries of the task

2. **Optimize for Simplicity**
   - Start with the minimal viable solution
   - Check if the goal can be achieved by modifying existing solutions
   - Consider if anything can be removed rather than added
   - Prefer straightforward approaches over complex ones

3. **Break Down into Atomic Steps**
   - Decompose the task into small, independent, testable units
   - Each step should have a clear input, action, and output
   - Steps should be executable in isolation when possible
   - Include verification/testing criteria for each step

4. **Structure Your Plan**
   - Prerequisites: What needs to be in place before starting
   - Steps: Numbered, actionable tasks with clear outcomes
   - Dependencies: Which steps rely on others
   - Checkpoints: Where to verify progress and adjust if needed
   - Success Criteria: How to know when the plan is complete

5. **Consider Edge Cases**
   - What could go wrong at each step?
   - What are the fallback options?
   - Where might iterations be needed?

## Output Format

Present your plan as:
1. Goal Statement (one clear sentence)
2. Clarifying Questions (if any)
3. Prerequisites
4. Step-by-Step Plan (numbered, with sub-steps as needed)
5. Success Metrics
6. Potential Risks & Mitigations
