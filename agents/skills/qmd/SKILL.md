# QMD - Query Markdown Documents

## How search works

QMD searches local markdown collections: notes, docs, wikis, transcripts, and
project knowledge bases. Use it before web search when the answer may already be
in indexed local files.

The workflow is always:

1. Search for candidate documents.
2. Retrieve the full source with `qmd get` or `qmd multi-get`.
3. Answer from retrieved text, citing paths or docids.

Do not answer from snippets alone when the user needs facts, decisions, quotes,
or nuance. Snippets are only leads.

Typical loop:

```bash
qmd search "merchant reality support interviews" -n 5
# leads: #abc123 concepts/customer-proximity.md; #def432 sources/merchant-call.md
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def432" --md
```

For harder searches, use `qmd query` structured queries with `intent:`, `lex:`,
`vec:`, and `hyde:` fields.

When reporting what you retrieved, a compact note is enough; do not paste whole
files unless needed:

```text
Retrieved:
- #abc123 concepts/customer-proximity.md
- #def432 sources/merchant-call.md
```

## Pick the right search mode

Use **BM25 lexical search** when you know exact words, titles, names, code
symbols, or rare phrases:

```bash
qmd search "cockpit OKR Goodhart" -n 10
qmd search '"AI Before Headcount"' -c concepts -n 5
```

Use **hybrid semantic search** when the user describes an idea indirectly, uses
different wording than the source, or needs conceptual recall:

```bash
qmd query "decision quality depends on surfacing assumptions and context" -n 10
qmd query --json --explain "metrics as cockpit instruments but not OKRs"
```

Use **structured queries** for hard searches. They combine exact anchors with
semantic recall:

```bash
qmd query $'intent: Find the concept note about metrics as instruments without letting OKRs replace judgment.\nlex: cockpit instruments OKR Goodhart metrics judgment\nvec: data informed not metric driven product judgment\nhyde: A concept note says metrics are useful like cockpit instruments, but leaders should remain data-informed rather than metric-driven because OKRs and dashboards can Goodhart product judgment.'
```

Structured query fields:

- `intent:` states what you are trying to find and what to avoid.
- `lex:` uses exact terms, aliases, titles, and rare words.
- `vec:` paraphrases the idea in natural language.
- `hyde:` describes the document or answer that would satisfy the request.

If `qmd query` is slow or model/GPU setup fails, fall back to `qmd search` with
better lexical terms.

## Retrieve sources

Search results include docids like `#abc123` and `qmd://...` paths. Fetch them:

```bash
qmd get "#abc123"
qmd get qmd://concepts/ai-before-headcount.md --full
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def432" --md
qmd multi-get 'concepts/{ai-before-headcount.md,data-informed-not-metric-driven.md}' --md
qmd multi-get 'sources/podcast-2025-*.md' -l 80
```

Use `multi-get` when comparing several hits or gathering context across pages.
Use `--full` when the exact source matters.

## Discover what is indexed

```bash
qmd collection list
qmd ls
qmd status
```

Add collection filters when broad searches drift into the wrong corpus:

```bash
qmd search "headcount autonomous agents" -c concepts -n 10
qmd query "merchant support product reality" -c concepts -c sources -n 10
```

Omit `-c` to search everything.

## Query craft

Good QMD searches mix three things:

1. **Title/alias anchors:** exact page titles, named entities, phrases.
2. **Semantic paraphrase:** how a human would describe the idea.
3. **Negative space:** enough intent to avoid nearby-but-wrong concepts.

Examples:

```bash
# Exact-ish title lookup
qmd search '"arm the rebels" merchants tools big companies' -c concepts

# Semantic concept lookup
qmd query $'intent: Find the customer proximity concept, not generic customer delight.\nlex: support pseudonymous merchant customer interviews\nvec: founder stays close to merchant reality through support and product use'

# Source lookup
qmd search "six-week cadence WhatsApp merchant relationships Shawn Ryan" -c sources -n 10
```

## Setup and maintenance

Only mutate indexes when the user asked for setup or maintenance. Searching and
retrieving are safe; collection/index mutation is not a casual first step.

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd
qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes
qmd update
qmd embed
```

Health and diagnostics:

```bash
qmd doctor
qmd status
qmd pull
```

`qmd doctor` checks config, model cache, device/GPU setup, vector fingerprints,
and common environment overrides. If a model-backed command fails, run it before
changing configuration.

## Pitfalls

- **Do not stop at snippets.** Fetch documents before making claims.
- **Do not overuse semantic search.** If you know exact titles or terms, BM25 is
  faster and often better.
- **Do not mutate indexes casually.** `qmd collection add`, `qmd update`, and
  `qmd embed` change local state and can be expensive.
- **Model-backed commands can be environment-sensitive.** If `qmd query`,
  `qmd vsearch`, or reranking fails because local models/GPU are unavailable,
  use `qmd search` and stronger lexical/structured terms.
- **Ambiguous user wording needs intent.** Add `intent:` rather than hoping query
  expansion guesses the right domain.
- **Collection names matter.** Search `concepts` for synthesized wiki pages,
  `sources` for transcripts/raw source pages, and docs collections for code or
  project documentation.
