# Local Search

Local search engine for text files (markdown, code, ...).

## CLI

```bash
# Create collections for your notes, docs, and meeting transcripts
qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes
qmd collection add ~/Documents/meetings --name meetings
qmd collection add ~/work/docs --name docs

# Add context to help with search results, each piece of context will be returned when matching sub documents are returned. This works as a tree. This is the key feature of QMD as it allows LLMs to make much better contextual choices when selecting documents. Don't sleep on it!
qmd context add qmd://notes "Personal notes and ideas"
qmd context add qmd://meetings "Meeting transcripts and notes"
qmd context add qmd://docs "Work documentation"

# Generate embeddings for semantic search
qmd embed

# Search across everything
qmd query "quarterly planning process"  # Hybrid + reranking (best quality)
qmd query $'lex: X\nvec: Y'             # Structured
qmd query $'expand: question'           # Explicit expand
qmd search "project timeline"           # Fast keyword search
qmd vsearch "how to deploy"             # Semantic search

# Get a specific document
qmd get "meetings/2024-01-15.md"

# Get a document by docid (shown in search results)
qmd get "#abc123"

# Get multiple documents by glob pattern
qmd multi-get "journals/2025-05*.md"

# Search within a specific collection
qmd search "API" -c notes

# Export all matches for an agent
qmd search "API" --all --files --min-score 0.3
```

### Query Types

| Type | Method | Input |
|------|--------|-------|
| `lex` | BM25 | Keywords — exact terms, names, code |
| `vec` | Vector | Question — natural language |
| `hyde` | Vector | Answer — hypothetical result (50-100 words) |

### Writing Good Queries

**lex (keyword)**
- 2-5 terms, no filler words
- Exact phrase: `"connection pool"` (quoted)
- Exclude terms: `performance -sports` (minus prefix)
- Code identifiers work: `handleError async`

**vec (semantic)**
- Full natural language question
- Be specific: `"how does the rate limiter handle burst traffic"`
- Include context: `"in the payment service, how are refunds processed"`

**hyde (hypothetical document)**
- Write 50-100 words of what the *answer* looks like
- Use the vocabulary you expect in the result

**expand (auto-expand)**
- Use a single-line query (implicit) or `expand: question` on its own line
- Lets the local LLM generate lex/vec/hyde variations
- Do not mix `expand:` with other typed lines — it's either a standalone expand query or a full query document

### Intent (Disambiguation)

When a query term is ambiguous, use `--intent` to steer results:

```bash
qmd query --intent "web performance and latency" "performance"
```

Intent affects expansion, reranking, chunk selection, and snippet extraction. It does not search on its own — it's a steering signal that disambiguates queries like "performance" (web-perf vs team health vs fitness).

### Combining Types

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Know exact terms | `lex` only |
| Don't know vocabulary | Use a single-line query (implicit `expand:`) or `vec` |
| Best recall | `lex` + `vec` |
| Complex topic | `lex` + `vec` + `hyde` |
| Ambiguous query | Add `intent` to any combination above |

First query gets 2x weight in fusion — put your best guess first.

### Lex Query Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `term` | Prefix match | `perf` matches "performance" |
| `"phrase"` | Exact phrase | `"rate limiter"` |
| `-term` | Exclude | `performance -sports` |

Note: `-term` only works in lex queries, not vec/hyde.

### Optimized Output

The `--json` and `--files` output formats are designed for agents.

- Get structured results for an LLM: `qmd search "authentication" --json -n 10`
- List all relevant files above a threshold: `qmd query "error handling" --all --files --min-score 0.4`
- Retrieve full document content: `qmd get "docs/api-reference.md" --full`
